Hi, I'm Oleg!

I have been working in software development for over 15 years, in roles ranging from programmer, to team leader, and development office manager. I've built many enterprise projects and web applications, some still in use. The one I particularly like is a business app builder in New Day at Work Space, which allows users to define their own custom business entities, complete with relationships, customizable views and calculated fields.

I've always strived for development process improvement: back in the days my team was the first to employ Agile methodologies, and more recently, I've championed a mandatory code review practice with results of which I'm particularly happy about. While implementing Scrum in 2010 or migrating to git in 2014 is not exactly a cutting edge, being the first in a company to do so has given me a lot of experience.

My current technology stack is based on .NET on backend and TypeScript on frontend. As for my interests, I have an affinity for [functional programming](https://github.com/ogvolkov/ua-sp-accounting) - especially after I've read ['The Little MLer'](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-mler), and started to look at programming even in traditional languages from a slightly different angle.

I cannot say I'm particularly active in the open source community, but if there's a little bug I can fix, be it [NHibernate](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/pull/399), [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps/pull/338) or [fineuploader](https://github.com/FineUploader/fine-uploader/pull/1977), I'll do it. My pet projects are usually small and focused not on a technical tour de force, but rather on solving some practical problem I'd like to investigate - for example, to quickly [compare climates](https://github.com/ogvolkov/climate-comparison) of the two given places on Earth, or to picture [which Dutch towns are within an hour train ride from the current location](https://github.com/ogvolkov/ns-routes-retrieval).

Currently I'm working at [Workspace 365](https://www.workspace365.net).
